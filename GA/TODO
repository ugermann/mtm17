TODO
  OK	Describe system operation
  OK	Describe one mutation step (input for continued training).
  OK	Describe result of mutation.
  Implement one mutation step as batch.
  Implement basic evaluation of mutation results as batch.
  Prepare virtual machine which repeatedly
    downloads description of some mutation
    does continued training according to the description
    evaluates the result?
    saves the result ... somewhere.
  Prepare selection mechanism - probably script that will run on one machine and use results of evaluation may be sufficient in first implementation.
  Prepare population database - something to store description of individuals.
  Prepare mutation description generator. (Maybe also GA driven?)
  Prepare mutation description server. (Simple server with one address which returns each mutation description at most once.)
