Parameters should be probably passed as JSON, with structure described later:

Model
  string URI //where to find model files (directory)

ParallelCorpus
  string sourceURI //where to find source file
  string targetURI //where to find target file

Parameters
  map<string, string> parameters //is set of name:value combination sufficient? probably not - maybe they could be split to sections, each section could be marked by type and should be replaceable by another section of same type, maybe there could be specified functions for crossover of section types (zero to many functions) - worst implementation - fixed sequence of strings

Mutation
  ParallelCorpus trainingCorpora
  Parameters trainingParameters

MutationInstance
  Model originalModel
  Mutation mutation
  Model result

Evaluation
  ParallelCorpus testSet
  string metricId 

EvaluationInstance
  Model model
  Evaluation evaluation
  string result
