Description of various mutation generator strategies (there should be one generator node for each strategy)

Training corpus mutation (according to assumed input)
  Find sentences similar to input sentences in available parallel corpus, enrich training corpus by them (or use just them). Intuition: Teach the model to translate similar sentences.
    Modification: Focus just on sentences with bad translation (if known) - or make them most of the training batch to keep check of the old correct behaviour. Intuition: Teach the model the things it can't so far.
  Find sentences containing parts of input in available parallel corpus, try to use examples which lead to different translations. Intuition: Teach the model to distinguish between different senses of the same words using context.
    Modification: Focus just on parts of sentences with bad translation (if known).

Model mutation
  Train on known domain/problem sentences with high learning rate to converge as quickly as possible.
  Train on domain/problem sentences with low learning rate to adapt as preciselly as possible.
  Train on mix of common data and domain/problem sentences with low learning rate to introduce as small error/change as possible.
  Train on mix of common data and domain/problem sentences with high learning rate to quickly converge without forgetting old knowledge.

Parameter mutation
  Multiply real number parameters with some value near to 1.
  Add integer close to 0 to integer parameters.
  Multiply integer parameters by some real value between 0.5 and 2 and round the result.
