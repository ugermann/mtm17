Description of various crossover strategies:

Model crossover
  Weighted sum of weights of individual models
  Substraction of weights of predecessor from current model makes "operator" which should after adition to another similar model add learned capabilities - and maybe destroy something
  Composition of operators (with common predecessor): If change is in the same direction, use maximum change, if change is in opposite direction, use sum or arithmetical mean value.

Training should continue after model crossover before selection.

Corpus crossover
  Select subcorpus of each parent corpus, merge them together. Evaluation using learning and improvement of the model.

Parameter crossover
  Swap some consistent parameter groups between complete parameter sets. Has to be configured.
